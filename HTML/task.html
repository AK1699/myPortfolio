<p>Sometimes it just doesn't make sense. The man walking down the street in a banana suit. 
The llama standing in the middle of the road.
The fairies dancing in front of the car window. 
The fact that all of this was actually happening and wasn't a dream.</p>
<p>The boxed moved. That was a problem. Peter had packed the box three hours before and there was nothing inside that should make it move.
The question now was whether or not Peter was going to open it up and look inside to see why it had moved.
The answer to that question was obvious. Peter dropped the package into the mailbox so he would never have to see it again.</p>
